### 1.1. What is a Liquid Staking Token?

Liquid staking lets you participate in DeFi while earning staking yields. Liquid staking solves the [Staking Dilemma](https://learn.sanctum.so/guides/more-about-sanctum/sanctums-value-proposition) by giving you the best of both worlds – it lets you secure the network and use your SOL at the same time.

You can think of staking as putting gold in a vault, and liquid staking as issuing a piece of paper money (an IOU, "I owe you") for the gold in that vault. In the same way that a paper IOU can be redeemed at any time for the gold, a liquid staking token (LST) can be redeemed at any time for unstaked SOL. Unlike natively-staked SOL, this liquid staking token is transferable. It can be used in all of DeFi – borrow-lend, perps, stablecoin issuance, etc.

Jupiter Staked SOL (JupSOL) is a liquid staking token that is issued by Jupiter.

### 1.2. How secure is the JupSOL program?

JupSOL is powered by the SPL stake pool program. The SPL stake pool program is one of the safest programs in the world.

It has been [audited multiple times](https://learn.sanctum.so/docs/security/audits), is used by the largest stake pools like jitoSOL and bSOL, and has secured more than $1B of staked SOL for years without any issues.

The program authority is secured by a multisig that includes, among others, members from Sanctum, Jupiter, Mango, marginfi and Jito.

Any changes to the program will have to be approved by a majority vote from this multisig. No single party can unilaterally change the program.

We plan to significantly grow the size of the multisig and eventually freeze the program.

### 1.3. What are the fees associated with JupSOL?

Jupiter charges a small 0.1% SOL deposit fee to prevent an arbitrage attack on the pool. There are no withdrawal, stake deposit, validator commission or management fees.

### 1.4. How does JupSOL Work?

SOL that’s deposited into JupSOL is staked.

The staking rewards from that SOL accrue to the JupSOL token, which starts at 1:1 with SOL and grows in value over time relative to SOL.

(Note that while JupSOL will always increase relative to SOL, it may still lose value in dollar terms.) By simply holding JupSOL, you will earn staking rewards.

### 1.5. What is JupSOL?

JupSOL represents staked Solana (SOL) tokens with Jupiter’s validator, which is hosted and managed by Triton. Jupiter passes all validator rewards collected and 100% of MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) along to stakers for maximum yield. The JupSOL token is issued through Sanctum.

### 1.6. Where does the yield come from for JupSOL?

JupSOL maintains higher-than-market yields for staking your SOL by distributing:

- 100% of all of native staking rewards (no commission)

- 100% of rewards from Jito Tips

- 80-100% of all block rewards from Validators

When you hold JupSOL, you also help Jupiter improve its transaction landing rate, making it easier for all Jupiter users to swap, DCA or place limit orders more reliably during high network activity
