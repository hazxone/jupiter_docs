# **Guide: Mastering Your Jupiter Portfolio**

This guide will help you manage, customize, and troubleshoot your Jupiter Portfolio dashboard, ensuring you have an accurate and complete view of your assets.

## **1. Managing and Customizing Your View**

This section covers how to set up your portfolio to see all your assets in one place.

### 1.1. How to View Multiple Wallets at Once Using Bundles

If you want to track multiple wallets together, you can use the **Bundle** feature inside the address-book settings.

To create and use a bundle, follow these steps:
1.  Go to `portfolio.jup.ag`.
2.  Click on the Address-Book icon in the top right of the page.
3.  Click on "Manage Address Book".
4.  Click on the `+` symbol under the **Bundles** section.
5.  Add as many wallets as you want by typing the address or your domain name.

To view your bundle, simply click on the Address-book icon and select the bundle you want to see.

## **2. Troubleshooting Portfolio Discrepancies**

This section provides steps to take when you notice issues with the assets or values displayed in your portfolio.

### 2.1. Handling Missing Items from Your Dashboard

If you notice tokens or entire positions are not showing up, here is how to diagnose and report the issue.

#### 2.1.1. When Individual Tokens Are Missing

There are a few reasons why your tokens might be missing from your portfolio dashboard:
*   The token has very low liquidity on-chain, and therefore a relevant price cannot be shown.
*   The token is very new and is not priced yet.
*   A bug is causing the token not to show.

If you believe a token should be displayed, please fill out a ticket [here](https://support.jup.ag/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=18486452428188) with all the necessary details (such as the token mint and your wallet address) so the team can investigate.

#### 2.1.2. When Entire Positions (e.g., from a protocol) Are Missing

If you notice some assets, funds, or positions from a specific application are missing from your portfolio dashboard, the team will need to investigate and fix the problem.

For this, you are required to fill out a ticket [here](https://support.jup.ag/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=18486452428188) and provide the following necessary details:
1.  The protocol/application on which you notice the missing funds/assets (e.g., Jupiter Perps).
2.  The wallet address where you have the issue. This will be kept private and only used to resolve the issue.

### 2.2. Handling Incorrectly Displayed Information

If your assets are visible but the reported values are incorrect, follow these steps to report the problem.

#### 2.2.1. When a Position Shows the Wrong Value

If some of your positions are wrongly reported (e.g., wrong balance, wrong assets, or wrong value), you can submit a ticket for review.

Please submit the ticket [here](https://support.jup.ag/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=18486452428188) with the following details:
1.  The protocol on which you see the issue.
2.  The specific position concerned.
3.  The wallet on which you have the issue.
4.  (Optional) A screenshot of the position on the protocol's own website.

The team will do their best to fix it as soon as possible.

## **3. Expanding Jupiter Portfolio's Coverage**

This section explains how you can contribute to improving the platform by requesting support for new protocols.

### 3.1. How to Request a Missing Protocol Integration

If a protocol is missing from **Jupiter Portfolio**, you can submit a request to have it added.

*   Submit your request [here](https://feedback.jup.ag/b/portfolio-feedback).

The team will review the request and work on adding the protocol as soon as possible.
