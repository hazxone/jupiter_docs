## 1. Jupiter DAO Grants

### 1.1. What are Jupiter Dao Grants?

Jupiter DAO grants are for those who have begun working on something in the DAO, which they feel ready to take to the next level and pursue a workgroup. We are looking for hard workers who embrace execution & iteration over perfection.

More details here: [https://www.jupresear.ch/t/jupiter-dao-grants/22681.](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/jupiter-dao-grants/22681)

---

### 1.2. How to get a Jupiter DAO Grant?

1. Start Working and Find Allies - Find what the Jupiverse needs and spearhead it in a direction. For inspiration, consult resources like the [C.A.R.E Essay](https://x.com/SlorgoftheSlugs/status/1836925337881493513), or the [Jup & Juice Case Study](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/jup-juice-casestudy/), and remember — perfect is the enemy of the good. Lo-fi & experimentation will trump high quality but hesitancy every time.
2. Work with the DAO to Grow Together - The DAO is here to support you through various resources: Mentorship sessions with the CWG, CWG Office Hours (Mondays at 16:00 UTC), Jup & Juice participation, Consulting other workgroups, Community feedback/engagement.
3. Once you feel ready to scale things up, apply for a grant on the platform <https://earn.superteam.fun/grants/jupiter-dao-grants/.>You'll hear back within ~7 days if there's interest. Accepted applicants should track their progress for the retrospective.

---

### 1.3. How else can I be involved in the DAO?

---

### 1.4. What other opportunities are there for the community?

The DAO, Jupiter team, and Working Groups, occasionally have bounties and competitions for the community. These could involve but are not limited to: making content, creating artwork, video reviews, guides, threads or giving feedback. Such opportunities are communicated on X or Discord's WG-announcements channel.


---

## 2. Working Groups

### 2.1. I want to form a Working Group but I don’t know where to start?

There are several ways to get involved in the Jupiter DAO. Some good ways to just get started are:

1. Be helpful and work your way up to the Catdet role: Lot’s of catdets are doing things and have the best eyes and ears on the Jupiverse.
2. Volunteer or assist with ongoing initiatives, whether that be an existing working groups or general tasks like helping with the reddit.
3. Be on the lookout for any ongoing bounties
4. Create some form of content: videos, threads, etc, and then propagate it.
5. You can find some general ideas on what might be useful to the DAO in this essay [here](https://x.com/SlorgoftheSlugs/status/1836925337881493513).
6. Or just consume information and engage on the reddit, Jupresearch forum or Discord, and an idea may come to you over time.

---

### 2.2. How can I join a Working Group?

You can always contact any existing WG via their socials to discuss how you could bring value.

However, since Working Groups go through multiple stages before their vote, supporting and networking with new contributors in the early stages is a great organic way to become part of a future one, or even create your own.

---

### 2.3. How can I form a Working Group?

Forming a Working Group is a multi-step system that starts with doing work for the DAO, then receiving a grant, becoming a trial, and finally becoming a full fledged WG.

You can read more about that process here: [https://www.jupresear.ch/t/jupiter-dao-microgrants-initiative/21583.](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/jupiter-dao-microgrants-initiative/21583)

---

### 2.4. What is a Working Group?

They are small task forces of independent operators led by key ecosystem members, which guide critical work in areas like growing the Jupiter community, enhancing the Solana ecosystem, and creating processes for the DAO.

---

### 2.5. What are the current Working Groups?

Currently there are 6 Workgroups, which include:

Core Working Group - CWG: Jupiter DAO <https://x.com/jup_dao>

## 3. Staking, Voting, and Active Staking Rewards (ASR)

### 3.1. I unstaked my $JUP 30 days ago, but when I try to claim it, the transaction fails. Why?

Reclaiming your $JUP requires an open token account for $JUP in your wallet.

If you’ve used a wallet clean-up service to burn any empty token accounts, you can easily reopen it by buying a tiny amount of $JUP, and then you will be able to claim.

---

### 3.2. My $JUP is staked but I can't vote. Why?

Voting is an on chain transaction that requires gas fees. Do make sure you have a minimum of 0.01 Sol in your wallet when trying to vote.

---

### 3.3. I voted while I was unstaking and it says I voted with less voting power than I have. Why?

When voting while unstaking, your applied Voting Power is based on the voting power your staking account would have left at the end of the proposal.

This is by design, so someone with 2 days of unstaking left cannot vote, claim the unstaked tokens, transfer them, and vote again with a different wallet while the proposal is still active, essentially using the same tokens to vote twice.

---

### 3.4. How do I never miss a vote?

There are a few ways to stay informed. One is to always keep an eye on the Discord Announcements channel. Most votes and the leadup to them last at least 7-10, and votes themselves last 3-4 days. Often they are mentioned during the live events such as the weekly planetary call.

However, you can also keep watch on the [DAO Twitter](https://x.com/jup_dao) which not only posts vote calendars, but also reminders during a vote.

You have yet a 3rd option which is to opt into email reminders on the vote page, and select "Notify me" to be sent an email during a vote.

![DAO Page showing the location of 'Notify me' button](https://support.jup.ag/hc/article_attachments/20008320275996)

---

### 3.5. How will I receive my ASR rewards?

ASR rewards are distributed quarterly, and they have to be claimed. Connect your voting wallet to <https://vote.jup.ag/asr> when ASR claims go live and you'll see the eligible rewards as well as a button to claim them.

![ASR Page showing the location of 'Claim' button](https://support.jup.ag/hc/article_attachments/20235219986716)

Note that ASR rewards cannot be claimed while unstaking. You can either choose to wait for the Unstaking period to end, and then claim your ASR, or cancel the current Unstaking process, and claim your ASR.

---

### 3.6. How is ASR calculated?

This airdrop is done linearly, based on Participated Voting Power, which is calculated by Amount of Staked JUP when voting, and Number of Proposals Participated in.

The option you chose when voting has no impact on your rewards share.

The more $JUP staked while voting → the higher the rewards

The more proposals participated in → the higher the rewards

More on the ASR methodology here: [https://www.jupresear.ch/t/asr-active-staking-rewards-methodology/19338.](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/asr-active-staking-rewards-methodology/19338)

---

### 3.7. What is ASR?

ASR stands for Active Staking Rewards, and it's the Jupiter Dao staking rewards program,  rewarding Active members of the community who stake AND vote.   
Read more about ASR here: <https://www.jupresear.ch/t/asr-active-staking-rewards-notes/12032>

---

### 3.8. How do I vote?

Join the community discussions on Discord, Twitter, and the Research Forum, to educate yourself about any upcoming votes.

When a proposal is live, connect your wallet to the governance platform on <https://vote.jup.ag/> and scroll to the ‘Proposals’ section at the bottom. You'll see a list of all past proposals, with any active ones at the top. Selecting the proposal you wish to vote on will open a new page, with more details and the vote options.

Once you have made a decision, select the vote option you want to use, and click vote. Your vote will be registered, and you should now see a confirmation of what you voted for, and the voting power that you used.

Note that:

* You can always change your mind while the proposal is still active, and change your vote by simply voting again, differently**.**
* The vote option that you choose has no impact on your rewards share - you just have to vote.

See the guide below for step by step instructions:

**Step 1.** Connect your staking wallet to <https://vote.jup.ag/> and scroll down to the Proposals section.

![Screenshot showing the location of the 'Proposals' section](https://support.jup.ag/hc/article_attachments/20235097825692)

**Step 2.** Select the live vote from the list (the status will be Active). This will open that proposal page and vote options.

![Screenshot showing the location of the proposals that are active and not voted yet](https://support.jup.ag/hc/article_attachments/20235066152220)

**Step 3.** Once you have made a decision, select your preferred vote option, click the Vote button, and confirm the transaction with your wallet.

### 3.9. How do I Unstake my $JUP?

To Unstake your $JUP tokens, connect your wallet to the governance platform, and select the Unstake tab, located below your Voting Power. You can choose to unstake the full locked amount, or just a part of it, and start the 30 days unstaking process by selecting the Unstake button.

If you unstake all the locked $JUP, your Voting Power will decrease linearly for 30 days. If you have chosen to unstake only a part of your locked $JUP, your Voting Power is reduced instantly.

During this 30 days unstaking period, you can still vote on any live proposals with your available voting power, and qualify for rewards.

At the end of the 30 days unstaking period, your $JUP tokens will be unlocked, and you will have an option to claim them back to your wallet.   
  
See the guide below for step by step instructions:   
  
**Step 1.** Connect your staking wallet to the governance platform at <https://vote.jup.ag/>.

![DAO Screenshot page showing the location of 'Connect Wallet' button](https://support.jup.ag/hc/article_attachments/20232608405788)

**Step 2.** Select the Unstake tab, and choose the amount of tokens you want to unstake (select MAX to unstake everything or input a custom amount). Click the Unstake button, and confirm the transaction with your wallet. ![DAO Screenshot page showing the location of 'Unstake' button](https://support.jup.ag/hc/article_attachments/20232608410140)

**Step 3.** You will see your Voting power update once the transaction is confirmed, and a countdown, displaying the amount of time left until the tokens fully unlock and can be claimed. You can also cancel this process at any time by selecting the Cancel button.

![Screenshot showing your voting power and countdown](https://support.jup.ag/hc/article_attachments/20232622502684)

**Step 4.** Once the tokens fully unlock, select the Claim button and confirm the transaction. This will withdraw the tokens from the governance program to your wallet.

![Screenshot showing the location of the 'Claim' button](https://support.jup.ag/hc/article_attachments/20233888682652)

---

### 3.10. How do I Stake my $JUP?

To stake your $JUP tokens, connect your wallet to the governance platform on <https://vote.jup.ag/>, enter the amount of $JUP you wish to lock, and click ‘Stake’. The $JUP will leave your wallet and be deposited into a smart contract, but can be reclaimed at any time by undergoing a 30 day unstaking process.

See the guide below with step by step instructions:

**Step 1.** Visit the governance platform at <https://vote.jup.ag/>. You can do this via desktop, or your favourite wallet's Dapp browser on mobile. Click/tap the Connect button in the top right corner, and select the wallet you want to log in with.

![DAO screenshot showing the location of the Connect Wallet button](https://support.jup.ag/hc/article_attachments/20231576395676)

**Step 2.** Enter the amount of $JUP tokens you want to lock. Click/tap the ‘Stake’ button, and confirm the transaction.

![DAO ASR screenshot showing your voting power, input amount how much to stake and Stake button](https://support.jup.ag/hc/article_attachments/20231607694364)

**Step 3.** The $JUP tokens will leave your wallet, and you will see your Voting Power update on the governance site. You are now ready to vote on any live proposal!

## 4. The Community, J.U.P. and the DAO

### 4.1. What is the J.U.P.?

The J.U.P is Jupiter’s vision for a dynamic, multi-faceted, and synergistic community, which works in unison to move both Jupiter and the crypto space forward. It is composed of users, the team, the DAO, Catdets and Working Groups.

All of these groups together form the J.U.P, and you can read more about this concept here: [JUP an experiment in distributed strategic execution.](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/j-u-p-an-experiment-in-distributed-strategic-execution/7182%C2%A0)

![JUP - Jupiter United Planet and its components : Users, Team, DAO, Catdets, Work Groups](https://support.jup.ag/hc/article_attachments/20007956605852)

---

### 4.2. What is the Jupiter DAO?

It is a community-run system of governance, which seeks to actively push forward both Jupiter, and Solana, as a whole. The DAO conducts regular votes using the $JUP governance token. For the first year, the DAO will become the main talent pool for working groups, fund working group budgets, distribute grants, and more. Over time the DAO will further extend its scope and responsibilities as it becomes more decentralized.

Read about the DAO’s funding [here.](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/first-dao-funding/12333)

---

### 4.3. What are JUP DAO's Vision, Ethos, and Progress so far?

The foundation for the JUP DAO vision is outlined in [this essay](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/our-aspirations-for-the-jup-dao/11200) by Meow, with some of the major Ethos points being described [here](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/jup-cat-ppp-a-full-review-of-the-key-ethos-that-drives-jup/20875).

Additionally, the CWG quarterly reports below outline the vision for the DAO, progress made so far, and the CWG’s scope in relation to it:

CWG Quarterly Report #1: <https://www.jupresear.ch/t/cwg-quarterly-report-1/20094>

CWG Quarterly Report #2: <https://www.jupresear.ch/t/cwg-quarterly-report-2/26559>

CWG Quarterly Report #3: <https://www.jupresear.ch/t/cwg-quarterly-report-3/37895>

---

### 4.4. What are Catdets?

Catdets are Jupiter's community most active members - constantly contributing, and dedicated to uplifting others in the J.U.P.

You can recognize them by their blue coloured role in Discord. However, the role is not exclusively limited to Discord contributions, and you can become a catdet due to activity on Reddit, Twitter, or even the [Jupresearch Forum](https://www.jupresear.ch/) or IRL events.

To become a catdet, be active in chats, try helping new users, Embrace [the Catdet Ethos](https://catdets.jup.eco/docs/who-is-a-catdet/ethos), and become a true pillar of the Jupiter community. Over time, you will be noticed, and people will recommend you for the role.

To learn more about becoming a catdet, browse the official website at <https://catdets.jup.eco/>.
