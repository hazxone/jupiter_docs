# Jupiter Mobile
## 1. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1.1. Where is my SOL after using a credit card on Jupiter Mobile?

We offer on-ramping via Credit Card, using MoonPay. Read more [here](https://support.jup.ag/hc/en-us/articles/18296210191900-How-to-Buy-Tokens-on-Jupiter-Mobile):

After using our Jupiter Mobile onramp with Credit Card, your SOL balance should appear automatically within 15mins~, in your balances. Double check if you are using the correct wallet address (that you on-ramped to).

During periods of high usage, it might take longer to appear.

Contact [MoonPay support](https://support.moonpay.com/) if you need more help.

---

### 1.2. How do I withdraw from Jupiter?

Jupiter does not store your funds. Your "Balance" on Jupiter represents your wallet holdings on the Solana blockchain.

To withdraw your funds to fiat, you will need to off-ramp your funds from Solana back to Fiat (USD, etc).

Here are some commonly suggested off-ramping solutions:

- Going via a Centralized Exchange (Binance, Coinbase)

- Offramp solutions, such as Sphere Off-ramp.

Note: These platforms are not owned by Jupiter and we are unable to support you as you try them out.

---

### 1.3. How can I connect my hardware wallet to Jupiter Mobile?

Currently we do not support hardware support for Jupiter Mobile. It is currently being worked on and should be released early 2025.

---

### 1.4. Why can't I sell my tokens?

If you can't sell your tokens, here are the two most likely reasons:

1. The token creator has frozen your token account, and you are unable to transfer or sell the tokens

2. The liquidity for your token has been drained, usually by the creator as well.

In both cases, Jupiter is unable to help you sell your tokens. Feel free to reach out to us for more additional information.

---

### 1.5. I am seeing unauthorized transactions on my wallet. What do I do?

If you notice transactions in your wallet that you don't remember making yourself, your wallet may be compromised.  
To protect your assets, stop using this wallet immediately and move all funds to a fresh one.
