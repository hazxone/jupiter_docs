    "content": "# Jupiter DAO User Guide & Explainer\n\n## 1. Understanding the Jupiter DAO\n\n### 1.1 What is the Jupiter DAO?\nThe Jupiter DAO is a community-run system of governance that aims to actively advance both Jupiter and the Solana ecosystem as a whole. The DAO utilizes the **$JUP** governance token to conduct regular votes. In its initial year, the DAO will serve as the primary talent pool for working groups, fund their budgets, distribute grants, and more. Over time, the DAO's scope and responsibilities are expected to expand as it becomes more decentralized.\n\n### 1.2 Vision, Ethos, and Progress of the JUP DAO\nThe foundational vision for the JUP DAO is outlined in an essay by Meow, with its major ethos points described in a separate document reviewing the \"JUP Cat PPP.\" The Core Working Group (CWG) also releases quarterly reports that detail the DAO's vision, progress, and the CWG's scope in relation to it.\n\n### 1.3 What is the J.U.P. (Jupiter's Community Vision)?\nThe **J.U.P.** is Jupiter's vision for a dynamic, multi-faceted, and synergistic community that works together to move both Jupiter and the broader crypto space forward. It is comprised of several key groups: users, the team, the DAO, Catdets, and Working Groups. Together, these components form the J.U.P.\n\n## 2. Staking $JUP and Active Staking Rewards (ASR)\n\n### 2.1 Staking Your $JUP\nTo participate in governance and earn rewards, you can stake your **$JUP** tokens. Staking involves locking your tokens in a smart contract through the official governance platform.\n\n#### 2.1.1 How to Stake $JUP\n1.  **Step 1.** Visit the governance platform at `https://vote.jup.ag/` and connect your wallet by clicking the \"Connect\" button in the top right corner. This can be done on a desktop or through a Dapp browser in your mobile wallet.\n2.  **Step 2.** Enter the amount of **$JUP** you wish to lock and click the \"Stake\" button. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.\n3.  **Step 3.** Once the transaction is confirmed, the **$JUP** tokens will leave your wallet, and your Voting Power will be updated on the governance site. You are now ready to vote on proposals.\n\n### 2.2 Unstaking Your $JUP\nYou can reclaim your staked **$JUP** at any time by initiating a 30-day unstaking process.\n\n#### 2.2.1 How to Unstake $JUP\n1.  **Step 1.** Connect your staking wallet to the governance platform at `https://vote.jup.ag/`.\n2.  **Step 2.** Select the \"Unstake\" tab below your Voting Power. Choose the amount of tokens you want to unstake (either the full amount or a custom amount). Click the \"Unstake\" button and confirm the transaction.\n3.  **Step 3.** Your Voting Power will update, and a countdown will appear showing the time remaining until the tokens are fully unlocked. You can cancel this process at any time by selecting the \"Cancel\" button.\n4.  **Step 4.** After the 30-day unstaking period ends, select the \"Claim\" button and confirm the transaction to withdraw the tokens back to your wallet.\n\nDuring the 30-day unstaking period, you can still vote on live proposals with your available voting power and qualify for rewards. If you unstake all your locked **$JUP**, your Voting Power will decrease linearly over the 30 days. If you unstake only a portion, your Voting Power is reduced instantly.\n\n#### 2.2.2 Troubleshooting Unstaking Issues\n\n##### 2.2.2.1 Why did my unstaked JUP transaction fail?\nIf your transaction to claim your **$JUP** fails after the 30-day unstaking period, it is likely because your wallet does not have an open token account for **$JUP**. This can happen if you have used a wallet clean-up service that burns empty token accounts. To fix this, simply buy a tiny amount of **$JUP** to reopen the token account, and you will then be able to claim your unstaked tokens.\n\n### 2.3 Understanding Active Staking Rewards (ASR)\n\n#### 2.3.1 What is ASR?\n**ASR** stands for **Active Staking Rewards**. It is the Jupiter DAO's staking rewards program designed to reward active community members who both stake their **$JUP** and participate in voting.\n\n#### 2.3.2 How ASR is Calculated\nASR is distributed as a linear airdrop based on \"Participated Voting Power.\" This is calculated using two factors:\n*   The amount of **$JUP** you have staked when you vote.\n*   The number of proposals you participate in.\n\nThe more **$JUP** you have staked and the more proposals you vote on, the higher your rewards will be. The specific option you choose when voting (e.g., \"Yes\" or \"No\") has no impact on your share of the rewards; participation is what counts.\n\n#### 2.3.3 Receiving Your ASR Rewards\nASR rewards are distributed quarterly and must be actively claimed. To claim, connect your voting wallet to `https://vote.jup.ag/asr` when the claim period is live. You will see your eligible rewards and a button to claim them.\n\nNote that ASR rewards cannot be claimed while you are in the process of unstaking. You must either wait for the unstaking period to finish before claiming or cancel the unstaking process to claim your ASR.\n\n## 3. Voting in the Jupiter DAO\n\n### 3.1 How to Vote on Proposals\n1.  **Step 1.** Stay informed about upcoming votes by joining community discussions. When a proposal is live, connect your staking wallet to `https://vote.jup.ag/` and scroll down to the \"Proposals\" section.\n2.  **Step 2.** Select the active vote from the list. This will open the proposal page with more details and the voting options.\n3.  **Step 3.** Choose your preferred vote option, click the \"Vote\" button, and confirm the transaction with your wallet.\n4.  **Step 4.** The page will update to confirm your vote, displaying the voting power you used.\n\nYou can change your vote at any time while the proposal is still active by simply voting again with a different option.\n\n### 3.2 Never Miss a Vote: Staying Informed\nThere are several ways to stay informed about voting periods:\n*   Keep an eye on the **Discord Announcements channel**. Votes and their lead-up typically last 7-10 days, with the voting window itself lasting 3-4 days.\n*   Follow the **DAO Twitter account** (`@jup_dao`), which posts vote calendars and reminders.\n*   Opt into email reminders on the vote page by selecting \"Notify me\" to receive an email when a vote is active.\n\n### 3.3 Troubleshooting Voting Issues\n\n#### 3.3.1 My $JUP is Staked but I Can't Vote: Common Reasons\nVoting on the Jupiter DAO is an on-chain transaction that requires gas fees. Ensure you have a minimum of **0.01 SOL** in your wallet to cover these fees when you attempt to vote.\n\n#### 3.3.2 Voting Power Reduced During Unstaking: Why it Happens\nWhen you vote while in the process of unstaking, your applied Voting Power is based on the amount your staking account will have left at the end of the proposal's voting period. This is an intentional design to prevent a user from voting, unstaking, transferring the tokens to another wallet, and voting again on the same proposal, which would essentially allow the same tokens to be used for voting twice.\n\n## 4. Jupiter DAO Grants\n\n### 4.1 What are Jupiter DAO Grants?\nJupiter DAO grants are intended for community members who have already started working on a DAO-related initiative and feel ready to scale it up, with the ultimate goal of forming a workgroup. The DAO seeks hard workers who prioritize execution and iteration over perfection.\n\n### 4.2 How to Apply for a Jupiter DAO Grant\n1.  **Start Working and Find Allies:** Identify a need within the Jupiverse and begin working to address it. Experimentation and lo-fi approaches are valued over high-quality but hesitant efforts.\n2.  **Work with the DAO to Grow:** Utilize DAO resources for support, including mentorship sessions with the Core Working Group (CWG), attending CWG Office Hours (Mondays at 16:00 UTC), and engaging with the community for feedback.\n3.  **Apply for a Grant:** Once you are ready to scale up, apply for a grant on the platform at `https://earn.superteam.fun/grants/jupiter-dao-grants/`. Applicants can expect to hear back within approximately 7 days if there is interest.\n\n## 5. Jupiter DAO Working Groups\n\n### 5.1 What are Working Groups?\nWorking Groups (WGs) are small task forces composed of independent operators led by key ecosystem members. Their purpose is to guide critical work in areas such as growing the Jupiter community, enhancing the Solana ecosystem, and establishing processes for the DAO itself.\n\n### 5.2 Current Working Groups\nAs of now, there are 6 Working Groups:\n*   **Core Working Group (CWG):** Jupiter DAO (`@jup_dao`)\n*   **Uplink Working Group:** Jupiter Uplink (`@jup_uplink`)\n*   **Catdets Working Group (CAWG):** (`@JUPCatdets`)\n*   **JUP & JUICE Working Group (trial):** Jup and Juice (`@JUPANDJUICE`)\n*   **Design & Art Working Group (DAWG) (trial):** (`@jupdesignlabs`)\n*   **DevRel Working Group (DRWG) (trial):** (`@JupDevRel`)\n\n### 5.3 Participating in Working Groups\n\n#### 5.3.1 How to Join an Existing Working Group\nYou can contact any existing Working Group through their social media channels to discuss how you could contribute. A great way to get involved organically is to support and network with new contributors in their early stages, which may lead to becoming part of a future WG.\n\n#### 5.3.2 How to Form a New Working Group (and Where to Start)\nForming a Working Group is a multi-step process that begins with contributing to the DAO, followed by receiving a grant, becoming a trial WG, and finally graduating to a full-fledged WG.\n\nIf you want to form a WG but don't know where to start, consider these steps:\n*   Be helpful and active in the community, potentially working your way up to a **Catdet** role.\n*   Volunteer or assist with ongoing initiatives from existing WGs or general community tasks.\n*   Look out for and participate in any ongoing bounties.\n*   Create and share content such as videos or threads.\n*   Engage with discussions on Reddit, the Jupresearch forum, or Discord to develop ideas over time.\n\n## 6. General Community Involvement & Resources\n\n### 6.1 Other Ways to Get Involved in the DAO\nBeyond voting, grants, and working groups, you can participate in the Jupiter DAO in numerous ways:\n*   Attend CWG Office hours in Discord every Monday at 5 PM UTC.\n*   Read the Weekly Newsletters from the DAO Account (`@Jup_Dao`).\n*   Attend Regular Planetary calls for ecosystem updates.\n*   Post or comment on `Jupresearch` forum topics.\n*   Participate in the Jupiter subreddit or the Twitter community group.\n*   Help new users in language-specific channels or join a regional initiative.\n*   Earn a Cat of Culture or Catdet Role.\n*   Provide DAO feedback on the Jup Ideas post.\n*   Create content using the Midjourney Archive or the Jup Branding Kit.\n*   Attend a Jup & Juice podcast episode or the PPP Hour event on Discord.\n\n### 6.2 Understanding Community Roles\n\n#### 6.2.1 What are Catdets?\n**Catdets** are among Jupiter's most active community members, known for consistently contributing and uplifting others in the **J.U.P.** They are identifiable by their blue-colored role in Discord, but the role recognizes contributions across all platforms, including Reddit, Twitter, the Jupresearch Forum, and even in-person events. To become a **Catdet**, be active, help new users, and embody the Catdet Ethos. Over time, community members may recommend you for the role.\n\n### 6.3 DAO Resources & Tools\n\n#### 6.3.1 DAO Branding Kit and Creative Resources\nYou can find the full branding kit, including Jupiter and DAO logos, fonts, and colors, at `https://www.jup.eco/#brand`. An evolving guide on Midjourney and other AI tools is available at `https://www.jup.eco/#ai`. A large selection of images generated with the DAO’s Midjourney prompt is also available for community use.\n\n#### 6.3.2 Other Community Opportunities (Bounties, Competitions, etc.)\nThe DAO, the Jupiter team, and the various Working Groups occasionally offer bounties and competitions for the community. These opportunities can include creating content, artwork, video reviews, guides, or providing feedback. Announcements for these opportunities are typically made on X (formerly Twitter) or in the `WG-announcements` channel on Discord.",
