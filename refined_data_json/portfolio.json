  "content": "# Guide: Mastering Your Jupiter Portfolio\n\nThis guide will help you manage, customize, and troubleshoot your Jupiter Portfolio dashboard, ensuring you have an accurate and complete view of your assets.\n\n## **1. Managing and Customizing Your View**\n\nThis section covers how to set up your portfolio to see all your assets in one place.\n\n### 1.1. How to View Multiple Wallets at Once Using Bundles\n\nIf you want to track multiple wallets together, you can use the **Bundle** feature inside the address-book settings.\n\nTo create and use a bundle, follow these steps:\n1.  Go to `portfolio.jup.ag`.\n2.  Click on the Address-Book icon in the top right of the page.\n3.  Click on \"Manage Address Book\".\n4.  Click on the `+` symbol under the **Bundles** section.\n5.  Add as many wallets as you want by typing the address or your domain name.\n\nTo view your bundle, simply click on the Address-book icon and select the bundle you want to see.\n\n## **2. Troubleshooting Portfolio Discrepancies**\n\nThis section provides steps to take when you notice issues with the assets or values displayed in your portfolio.\n\n### 2.1. Handling Missing Items from Your Dashboard\n\nIf you notice tokens or entire positions are not showing up, here is how to diagnose and report the issue.\n\n#### 2.1.1. When Individual Tokens Are Missing\n\nThere are a few reasons why your tokens might be missing from your portfolio dashboard:\n*   The token has very low liquidity on-chain, and therefore a relevant price cannot be shown.\n*   The token is very new and is not priced yet.\n*   A bug is causing the token not to show.\n\nIf you believe a token should be displayed, please fill out a ticket [here](https://support.jup.ag/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=18486452428188) with all the necessary details (such as the token mint and your wallet address) so the team can investigate.\n\n#### 2.1.2. When Entire Positions (e.g., from a protocol) Are Missing\n\nIf you notice some assets, funds, or positions from a specific application are missing from your portfolio dashboard, the team will need to investigate and fix the problem.\n\nFor this, you are required to fill out a ticket [here](https://support.jup.ag/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=18486452428188) and provide the following necessary details:\n1.  The protocol/application on which you notice the missing funds/assets (e.g., Jupiter Perps).\n2.  The wallet address where you have the issue. This will be kept private and only used to resolve the issue.\n\n### 2.2. Handling Incorrectly Displayed Information\n\nIf your assets are visible but the reported values are incorrect, follow these steps to report the problem.\n\n#### 2.2.1. When a Position Shows the Wrong Value\n\nIf some of your positions are wrongly reported (e.g., wrong balance, wrong assets, or wrong value), you can submit a ticket for review.\n\nPlease submit the ticket [here](https://support.jup.ag/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=18486452428188) with the following details:\n1.  The protocol on which you see the issue.\n2.  The specific position concerned.\n3.  The wallet on which you have the issue.\n4.  (Optional) A screenshot of the position on the protocol's own website.\n\nThe team will do their best to fix it as soon as possible.\n\n## **3. Expanding Jupiter Portfolio's Coverage**\n\nThis section explains how you can contribute to improving the platform by requesting support for new protocols.\n\n### 3.1. How to Request a Missing Protocol Integration\n\nIf a protocol is missing from **Jupiter Portfolio**, you can submit a request to have it added.\n\n*   Submit your request [here](https://feedback.jup.ag/b/portfolio-feedback).\n\nThe team will review the request and work on adding the protocol as soon as possible.\n\n\n---",
