  "content": "## 1. Introduction to Jupiter Mobile\n### 1.1 What is Jupiter Mobile?\n**Jupiter** is dedicated to building the largest decentralized platform and the best community in crypto.\n\n**Jupiter Mobile** brings Jupiter's powerful trading features to your smartphone. It is designed for quick and easy onboarding, allowing for instant swaps and more, all with zero platform fees.\n\n## 2. Getting Started with Jupiter Mobile\n### 2.1 Downloading the App\nTo get started, you first need to download the application. Once installed, you can open **Jupiter Mobile** to either create a new wallet or import an existing one.\n\n#### 2.1.1 For iOS Users\n*   Visit the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jupiter-mobile/id6484069059) to download the app.\n\n#### 2.1.2 For Android Users\n*   Visit the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ag.jup.jupiter.android) to download the app.\n\n### 2.2 Creating a New Wallet\nOnce the app is installed, you can create a new wallet by following these steps:\n\n1.  **Follow On-Screen Prompts**: Open the app and select the option to **Create a New Wallet**. The app will guide you through each step.\n2.  **Name Your Wallet**: Choose a suitable name for your wallet. Note that Jupiter does not have access to wallet names; they are stored only locally on your device.\n3.  **Back Up Your Recovery Phrase**: You will be given a Secret Recovery Phrase. Write it down and keep it in a secure location. This phrase is the only way to recover your wallet if you lose access to your device. **Never share your recovery phrase**â€”anyone who has it can access your wallet, and lost funds cannot be recovered.\n4.  **More Security Measures**: For additional security, you can secure your Recovery Phrase with iCloud Backup. The app also utilizes your device's biometric features (Face ID) for added protection.\n\n### 2.3 Importing an Existing Wallet\nIf you already have a Solana wallet, you can easily import it into **Jupiter Mobile** using your Secret Recovery Phrase.\n\n1.  Go to your Profile section and tap the `+` icon.\n2.  Select **Import Wallet**.\n3.  Enter your 12 or 24-word Secret Recovery Phrase.\n4.  Choose which wallets to import and tap **Continue**.\n\n## 3. Managing Your Funds on Jupiter Mobile\n### 3.1 How to Buy Tokens\n#### 3.1.1 Using Apple Pay or Credit/Debit Card (via MoonPay)\nYou can buy crypto on **Jupiter Mobile** using Apple Pay or a Credit/Debit Card through our partner, **MoonPay**.\n\n1.  On your portfolio page, tap the `+` icon at the bottom right and select 'Buy'.\n2.  Currently, only the purchase of **SOL** is supported via this method. You can swap your **SOL** for any other token within the app after purchase.\n3.  Enter the USD amount you wish to spend for the equivalent amount of **SOL**.\n4.  Choose your payment method (Apple Pay or Credit/Debit Card).\n5.  Sign up using your email and provide a few quick details. The purchased funds should arrive in your wallet almost instantly.\n\n#### 3.1.2 Swapping Existing Crypto\nTo swap your existing tokens for other ones:\n1.  Navigate to the Swap page by tapping the 'ðŸš€' icon.\n\n### 3.2 Sending and Receiving Tokens\n**Sending Tokens**\n1.  On your portfolio page, tap the `+` icon at the bottom right and select 'Send'.\n2.  Select the amount and enter the destination wallet address. You can paste a full address, scan a QR code, or choose a saved contact.\n3.  Confirm the transfer by selecting 'Send'.\n\n**Receiving Tokens**\n1.  On your portfolio page, tap the `+` icon at the bottom right and select 'Receive'.\n2.  You can copy and share your wallet address or the QR code with the person sending you tokens.\n\n### 3.3 Understanding Fees\nThere are two main types of fees you may encounter when using **Jupiter Mobile**.\n\n#### 3.3.1 Fees for On-ramping (MoonPay)\nIf you buy **SOL** on **Jupiter Mobile** using Apple Pay or a credit card via **MoonPay**, you will incur a small percentage fee. The exact amount may change, so it is best to consult **MoonPay's** support documentation for the most up-to-date information.\n\n#### 3.3.2 Fees for Swapping (Ultra Mode)\n**Jupiter** abstracts away slippage, MEV, and other technical configurations so you can trade easily. For using **Ultra Mode**, there is a fee of 0.1% per trade. Using **Ultra Mode** is optional, but it makes trading much easier. You can continue using the free Manual mode on the web platform at `jup.ag`.\n\n### 3.4 Where is My SOL After Purchase?\nAfter using the **Jupiter Mobile** on-ramp with a credit card via **MoonPay**, your **SOL** balance should appear automatically in your balances within approximately 15 minutes. During periods of high usage, this may take longer.\n\nIf your funds have not appeared, double-check that you are viewing the correct wallet address you on-ramped to. For further assistance, please contact **MoonPay** support.\n\n### 3.5 Withdrawing Funds and Off-ramping\n**Jupiter** does not store your funds. The \"Balance\" displayed in the app represents your wallet holdings on the Solana blockchain. To withdraw your funds to fiat (e.g., USD), you need to off-ramp them.\n\n#### 3.5.1 Jupiter Mobile's Off-ramp Policy\nOff-ramping, which is the process of converting crypto to fiat currency, is currently **not available** on **Jupiter Mobile**. You can buy, send, receive, and trade between different tokens on Solana using the app.\n\n#### 3.5.2 General Off-ramping Solutions\nTo off-ramp your funds from Solana back to fiat, you will need to use an external service. Some commonly suggested solutions include:\n*   Going through a Centralized Exchange (e.g., Binance, Coinbase).\n*   Using off-ramp solutions, such as Sphere Off-ramp.\n\nPlease note that these platforms are not owned by **Jupiter**, and we are unable to provide support for their services.\n\n## 4. Exploring and Interacting with Jupiter Mobile\n### 4.1 How to Find New Tokens\n#### 4.1.1 Searching in the Swap Section\nYou can find new tokens by searching for them in the Swap section. **Jupiter** only shows verified tokens based on an index of metrics that cannot be botted or faked, which helps protect users from imposter tokens.\n\n#### 4.1.2 Using Magic Scan\nWith the **Magic Scan** feature, you can also find tokens by scanning a QR code, or by simply sharing or pasting a photo or text.\n\n### 4.2 Finding More Information About a Specific Token\nYou can find comprehensive data about a specific token directly within **Jupiter Mobile**.\n\n1.  Go to your portfolio page and select any token.\n2.  This will open a new token page that displays price charts, details about the token supply, and a history of your swaps involving that token.\n\n**Note:** This feature is currently available for iOS users and will be brought to Android in the coming weeks.\n\n### 4.3 Accessing Other Solana dApps\nYou can access other Solana dApps through the integrated dApp Browser on **Jupiter Mobile**.\n\n1.  Find the browser icon in the top right corner of the app.\n2.  Enter the URL of the dApp you want to use in the search bar (e.g., `kamino.finance`, `sanctum.so`).\n\n### 4.4 Inviting Friends to Jupiter Mobile\nYou can easily get your friends and family started on Solana with an invite.\n\n1.  Open the Invite tab in your **Jupiter Mobile** app and tap the 'Invite' button.\n2.  Create an invite with a small amount of **SOL** from your wallet.\n3.  Send the invite link to your friends and family. Once they download **Jupiter Mobile**, they can claim their gifted **SOL** right away.\n4.  If the **SOL** is unclaimed, it will be returned to your wallet after one week.\n\n## 5. Frequently Asked Questions and Troubleshooting\n### 5.1 Why Can't I Log Into Jupiter Mobile?\nIf you are experiencing frequent crashes or login problems, please ensure you are using the latest version of **Jupiter Mobile** from your device's App Store.\n\n### 5.2 I Am Seeing Unauthorized Transactions on My Wallet. What Do I Do?\nIf you notice transactions in your wallet that you do not recognize, your wallet may be compromised. To protect your assets, you should stop using this wallet immediately and move all remaining funds to a fresh, new wallet.\n\n### 5.3 Why Can't I Sell My Tokens?\nIf you are unable to sell your tokens, there are two likely reasons:\n1.  The token creator has frozen your token account, preventing you from transferring or selling the tokens.\n2.  The liquidity for your token has been drained, which is usually also done by the creator.\n\nIn both of these situations, **Jupiter** is unable to help you sell your tokens.\n\n### 5.4 I Am Unable to Stake My JUP via Jupiter Mobile\nTo stake your **JUP**, you need to use the dApp browser within **Jupiter Mobile**.\n\n1.  Go to `vote.jup.ag` from the dApp browser. Ensure you have enough **SOL** (for transaction fees) and **JUP** in your wallet.\n2.  If this process still doesnâ€™t work, please provide a transaction ID to the support team so they can reproduce and resolve the issue.\n\n### 5.5 Why Can't I See My Full Trade History?\nCurrently, **Jupiter Mobile** only displays your swap history. An update is being worked on that will show your complete wallet activity, including token transfers.\n\n### 5.6 How Can I Connect My Hardware Wallet to Jupiter Mobile?\nCurrently, **Jupiter Mobile** does not support hardware wallets. This feature is being worked on and is expected to be released in early 2025.\n\n### 5.7 Why is Jupiter Mobile Not Available in My Country?\n**Jupiter Mobile** is currently unavailable in a few regions due to local regulations. We are actively working to restore service in affected areas. In the meantime, you can access Jupiter's features through our web platform at `jup.ag`.\n\n### 5.8 Can I Access the Jupiter App on Web as a Browser Extension?\nNo. **Jupiter Mobile** is developed exclusively for mobile devices and is not available as a browser extension. For trading on a computer, please visit `jup.ag` to access the **Jupiter** web platform.",
