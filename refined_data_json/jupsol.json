Introduction: The Fundamentals\n\nThis section introduces the core concepts a user needs to understand before diving deeper into JupSOL's specifics.\n\n### What is a Liquid Staking Token (LST)?\n\nA Liquid Staking Token (**LST**) allows you to participate in DeFi while earning staking yields. It solves the \"Staking Dilemma\" by letting you secure the network and use your **SOL** at the same time.\n\nYou can think of this process using an analogy:\n*   Staking is like putting gold in a vault.\n*   Liquid staking is like issuing a paper IOU (\"I owe you\") for that gold.\n\nJust as the paper IOU can be redeemed for the gold, an **LST** can be redeemed at any time for unstaked **SOL**. Unlike natively-staked **SOL**, an **LST** is transferable and can be used across all of DeFi for activities like borrowing, lending, perpetuals trading, and stablecoin issuance.\n\n### What is JupSOL?\n\n**JupSOL** is a liquid staking token that represents staked Solana (**SOL**) tokens with **Jupiter's** validator. This validator is hosted and managed by Triton. The **JupSOL** token is issued through **Sanctum**.\n\nBy holding **JupSOL**, stakers receive maximum yield, as **Jupiter** passes along all collected validator rewards and 100% of MEV (Maximal Extractable Value).\n\n## 2. How JupSOL Works\n\nThis section explains the mechanics of the **JupSOL** token, from how it operates to its financial aspects.\n\n### The Core Staking Mechanism\n\nWhen **SOL** is deposited into **JupSOL**, it is staked. The staking rewards generated from that **SOL** accrue directly to the **JupSOL** token.\n\nThe **JupSOL** token starts at a 1:1 value with **SOL** and is designed to grow in value over time relative to **SOL**. By simply holding **JupSOL**, you earn staking rewards.\n\nIt is important to note that while **JupSOL** is designed to always increase in value relative to **SOL**, it may still lose value in dollar terms if the price of **SOL** decreases.\n\n### Understanding Yield Generation\n\n**JupSOL** maintains higher-than-market yields by distributing several sources of rewards to its holders. The yield comes from:\n\n*   100% of all native staking rewards (with no commission).\n*   100% of rewards from Jito Tips.\n*   80-100% of all block rewards from Validators.\n*   100% of MEV (Maximal Extractable Value).\n\nAdditionally, holding **JupSOL** helps **Jupiter** improve its transaction landing rate, which makes it easier for all **Jupiter** users to swap, DCA, or place limit orders more reliably, especially during periods of high network activity.\n\n### Associated Fees\n\n**Jupiter** charges a small **0.1% SOL deposit fee**. This fee exists to prevent a potential arbitrage attack on the pool.\n\nThere are no other fees associated with **JupSOL**. This includes:\n*   No withdrawal fees\n*   No stake deposit fees\n*   No validator commission fees\n*   No management fees\n\n## 3. Security and Trust\n\nThis section addresses the critical topic of security, detailing the measures in place to protect users' funds.\n\n### The Security of the JupSOL Program\n\n**JupSOL** is powered by the **SPL stake pool program**, which is considered one of the safest programs in the world. Its security is supported by the following:\n\n*   It has been **audited multiple times**.\n*   It is used by the largest stake pools, including **jitoSOL** and **bSOL**.\n*   It has a long track record of securing more than $1 billion of staked **SOL** for years without any issues.\n\n### Governance and Program Authority\n\nThe program authority for **JupSOL** is secured by a **multisig** wallet. This means that any changes to the program must be approved by a majority vote from the multisig members, and no single party can unilaterally alter the program.\n\nThe multisig includes members from several reputable organizations, including:\n*   **Sanctum**\n*   **Jupiter**\n*   **Mango**\n*   **marginfi**\n*   **Jito**\n\nThere are plans to significantly grow the size of this multisig and to eventually freeze the program to further enhance its security.\n",
