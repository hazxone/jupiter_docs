# $JUP / Jupuary

## 1.1. Transparency Disclosures: $JUP

### **What is Jupiter?**

Jupiter is building the DeFi Superapp. Jupiter is the liquidity infrastructure that enables seamless, capital-efficient trading across the Solana ecosystem. It routes billions in daily volume by connecting users and protocols to the best prices across all major DEXs and market makers through RFQ and smart routing. Jupiter’s advanced engine powers instant swaps, recurring orders, trigger-based orders, and perpetual trading, while also serving as the core liquidity layer for integrated DeFi applications. Beyond trading, Jupiter is building products for money markets, mobile traders, DeFi power users via Portfolio, and more. Through deep integrations, robust APIs, and a relentless focus on both user and developer experience, Jupiter is laying the foundation for the next generation of financial applications on Solana

### **Where Does Jupiter's Revenue Come From?**

Jupiter derives revenue from fees charged on its perpetuals, spot swaps, limit order/DCA and on-chain/off-chain liquidity aggregation products. Half of onchain revenues are sent to the Litterbox Trust, which has the mandate to accumulate $JUP. The other half of onchain revenues, along with offchain revenues ultimately forms the operational budget of the team (with excess going into treasury reserves) which is distributed across various Foundation and Labs entities.  
  
For the avoidance of doubt, none of the profit (revenues net of costs) flow through to founders or insiders.

### **Does Any Value Accrue to Jupiter Equity Holders?**

No value is accrued to equity holders, all revenues across Jupiter products are used to grow the protocol and its range of product offerings. There are no present or future plans to return cash flow to equity through dividends or share repurchases and a corporate restructure is currently in progress to ensure that any excess cash would flow into a non-profit entity instead of the Development Entity, making it structurally impossible to return cash to equity holders.  
  
Since February 2025, 50% of all onchain Jupiter revenues have been programmatically allocated to a non-profit Litterbox Trust and used to acquire $JUP on the open market as a [long term strategic reserve.](https://meow.bio/jup-4.html)

### **Does Jupiter Have Any Special Advisor Billings to the Foundation?**

There are no advisory payments to insiders from the Foundation. All team members are paid out of the team allocation of tokens and subject to vesting.

### **What Governance Rights / Value Accrual Do $JUP Holders Have?**

$JUP tokenholders are able to stake $JUP in order to participate in governance of the Jupiter DAO. Governance participants are able to earn ASR (Active Staking Rewards) in the form of staked $JUP, essentially allowing those who participate in governance to accrue more governance power over time.  
  
The JupiterDAO itself has been seeded with 100m $JUP and 10m $USDC, and $JUP tokenholders are able to vote on proposals relating to the allocation of these assets. $JUP tokenholders do not receive a direct % of fees but they are able to indirectly benefit from the revenues of the network given such revenues are used to programmatically purchase $JUP for the team’s long-term reserves.  
  
Governance is driven by the Core Working Group (CWG) - the members of which are not appointed by the Jupiter team.  
  
Further utility for $JUP stakers such as fee discounts, access to token launches, airdrops and other utility is also being considered across the Jupiter suite of products.

### **What was the Initial Allocation of $JUP?**

Details about the initial allocation of $JUP along with the basic tokenomics can be found in [this post](https://x.com/weremeow/status/1735544950417436806) from Meow, the co-founder of Jupiter.

### Will Jupiter Always Publicly Disclose Any Token Issuance (e.g. minting/emissions) Going Forward?

Yes! Check out the specifics from Jupuary 2024 [in this post from Mei](https://x.com/9yointern/status/1728816741076361659), and from Jupuary 2025 [in this post from Kash](https://x.com/kashdhanda/status/1879554632449507360) as two examples of our commitment to transparency. The specific list of airdroped wallets for 2024 can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ayxMQVutULTxEQbRVzY-rVxO_t5-mP5W/view?usp=sharing), while 2025 can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nKj2MLwG83YVQYs0GMiuSUorl-We7X_B/view?usp=sharing).

### Are the Team's $JUP Tokens Vesting Onchain? Are They Able to Receive Rewards (e.g. ASR) While They Vest?

Yes! You can see them here on Jupiter Lock.No locked tokens can earn rewards, and all team members are on a standard 1 year cliff + 3 year vesting term. Team members would only be able to receive ASR after their tokens are unlocked.

### Where Can I Find the Unissued Token Wallets?

Those are publicly reviewed every ~6 months in our industry-leading Transparency Reports. The wallet address can be found in any of those reports, including the [Feb 2025 report here.](https://discuss.jup.ag/t/jup-community-audit-feb-2025/34764)

### Is the Jupiter Team Going to Launch Any Additional Tokens?

The team will not launch any future tokens, although note that the co-founders of Jupiter are also the co-founders of Meteora (this is very publicly known) (https://meteoraag.medium.com/). Meteora may launch a token in the future. Note that no Meteora revenue currently flows through Jupiter entities and its balance sheets are kept entirely separate.  
  
For completeness, the team as part of its product suite may launch receipt tokens (i.e. receipts of LP positions, liquid staked tokens, test tokens etc) but there are no plans to launch any governance or protocol tokens which dilutes the economics of $JUP.

### Is the Team Committed to Disclosing Any Insider/Related Person Transactions, Publicly?

We commit to disclosing all related party transactions within 30 days.

### What Token Sales, Market Maker Deals, and Exchange Listings has the Team Conducted?

Jupiter has never conducted an OTC sale and has not made any discounted sales to market makers. The team worked with three market makers: 

* Kbit: 6 million tokens amounting to 0.06% of total supply at launch, 0.086% (post-burn). Call options over 2 million tokens. 2 year term.
* Wintermute: 15 million tokens amounting to 0.15% of total supply at launch, 0.214% (post-burn). Call option over 5 million tokens. 2 year term.
* DWF: 20 million tokens amounting to 0.20% of total supply at launch, 0.286% (post-burn), call option over 20 million tokens. 2 year term.

Jupiter has never directly allocated any tokens to centralized exchanges for market making. 10 million tokens were provided to DWF to facilitate listing arrangements independently of Jupiter and Jupiter is not party to any listing agreements.

## 2. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### 2.1. I have already lost access to the email I used on my profile. Please help.

We are discussing how to handle this safely and will update you again.

---

### 2.2. I was flagged as a sybil and believe a mistake was made. How do I appeal?

If you are able to appeal, you will see a message on your dashboard. We are still working out the details but we expect that you can begin appeal towards the end of January. Details will be released later, so watch your inbox.

---

### 2.3. I have a compromised wallet. What can I do?

Please mark your wallet as compromised at <https://jupuary.jup.ag/compromised> immediately.

---

### 2.4. I am an Ape user. How do I check my allocation?

We will implement notifications separately on Ape.

---

### 2.5. When will the Good Cats allocation be out? I have filled out the form.

If you have made significant contributions to the Jupiverse over the past year, you can apply for a Good Cats allocation on your dashboard. This will be processed after Catstanbul.

---

### 2.6. Can I unlink my wallets?

Yes, you can un-link your wallets at any time from your profile.

---

### 2.7. I am an expert trader and I am disappointed.

We’re sorry you feel that way :( The top tier for swap users is 20K JUP while the top tier for expert traders go up to 300K JUP, so expert traders could get more for each wallet.

However, overall volume is quite intense this year and it can be challenging to qualify for the next tier. E.g. From tier 8 to tier 7, users trade about $20K - $27M more.

Our most disappointed users tend to be those in the smaller tiers, trading consistently but narrowly missing the next tier. It’s frustrating to just miss out, and we know that feeling (from ahem looking at our own wallets). The overall user allocations are unlikely to change at this stage but we are discussing to see if there is anything more we can do for this group from upcoming Carrots.

---

### 2.8. How is my expert allocation calculated?

Your score is based on relative protocol fees paid for DCA, LO, Perps and Ape, since that allows us to normalize different activities. You are then sorted into tiers based on your score relative to other users.

Many of you wanted references to understand what that means in terms of volume. For perp users, volume varies widely for people in each tier because there are many factors that impact fees paid on trades of the same size such as borrow rate, leverage, and length of time that the order was opened. You can see the median volumes for each tier in the table in your allocation breakdown view.

More context:

* The minimum qualifying volume was $17
* Someone with 100K in trading volume might be in tier 7 - 9
* Someone with 1M in trading volume might be in tier 4 - 8
* Yes, the scale is mind-boggling this year and 100M in trading volume might land you in tier 5

---

### 2.9. I am a DCA / LO user and I feel like Swap users got more.

This is not possible. You got attributed for both Swap and Expert categories. Your allocation in Swap is exactly the same as what a swap user got for their score. Same for the expert category.

---

### 2.10. Tell me about how my staking score is calculated.

We look at your time-weighted stake, which is from an average of 2 snapshots taken every month since the start of Jupiter staking.

A super voter bonus is given if you voted in at least 13 out of 17 proposals. A super staker bonus is given if you have staked and never unstaked all the way to 11 Jan 2025 . For the bonuses, you must have > 10 JUP staked on 1st Nov 2024.

To qualify, your minimum final allocation needs to be > 10 JUP (Stakers get $0.082 - $0.31 per time-weighted JUP).

---

### 2.11. Dune says I moved XX volume, what does that mean?

In terms of raw volume, the popular 3rd party trackers seem to be counting volume of each hop within a swap, effectively doubling or tripling the numbers compared to ours.

Ultimately we look at your score, and it is based on volume but adjusted in many ways (for funky trades, circular transactions, sol-sol & stables are discounted etc, <= $5 transactions not counted, reliable price data needed for less liquid tokens etc).

---

### 2.12. How is my swap score calculated?

* Your swap score includes transactions between 2 Nov 23 - 1 Nov 24.
* On the wallet side we removed bots, sybils, wallets trading for under 3 weeks, and wallets trading mostly illiquid pairs.
* On the swap side, we removed Circular Txns, Swaps <= 5 USD, and Swaps on illiquid tokens without reliable pricing data.
* The volume of stable-stable swaps and sol-sol swaps are heavily discounted in your score.

---

### 2.13. What are the categories of allocation available?

There are allocations for Swap, Expert Traders, Stakers and Carrots. On top of that, there are additional bonuses for swap consistency (swap 8 months or more) and for being very involved in governance (super voters have voted in 13 or more proposals, super stakers have never unstaked).

---

### 2.14. When can we claim? How?

Claims will go live before Catstanbul and will stay open for 3 months. We will confirm the date and time on our official Twitter account next week.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To claim, your wallet must be connected to a Jupiverse profile. Each profile can link up to 20 wallets and the allocation on each wallet has to be claimed separately. We recommend linking your wallets before claims open for a smoother claim experience.

---

### 2.15. Why do I need a Jupiverse profile this year?

Jupiverse Profiles are a unified identity system for the entire Jupiter ecosystem. It's a foundational step in growing and strengthening our community. By creating a cohesive identity system, we can better understand and engage with our community members, connecting the Jupiverse more deeply than ever before.

Creating your profile is simple: just link your email address, connect your wallets, and you will be able to manage and view your airdrop allocation in one dashboard.

Going forward, your Profile will serve as your central hub for everything Jupiter-related: from airdrops and Good Cats applications to future product launches and community initiatives.

### 2.16. Tell us more about Jupuary 2025, the thinking behind allocations, and some of the background work.

Go and read this beautiful [essay](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/jupuary-2025-overview-checker/32013) by Kash who gives us plenty of important context.

### 2.17. Some claim specific hot questions

* **Sybil appeals:** Please do not open a ticket. Instead wait until after January 27th when appeals open. There will be an announcement in Discord and you can see an appeals section on your dashboard, so wait until then.
* **JUP mobile bonus:** You can claim on any device and it will not affect your future carrots. We will explain the specifics around the Jupiter Mobile carrots after Catstanbul. We know we said claiming on Jupiter Mobile would give a bonus earlier, but plans have changed!
* **I used to see 25 JUP on my allocation but I don’t see it anymore:** Smol issue. You were mistakenly shown that you were eligible for an allocation when you actually didn't qualify. But good news! We're going to give you exactly what you were shown. Give us about a week - it'll show up automatically in your dashboard, no need to open a ticket.
* **Lost email:** Please wait until after January 27th to submit a ticket on discord.
* **Email login issues:** First, check if you typed your email correctly. If it is correct, then wait a bit to resend. The pin will be valid 2 hours from time of request. Make sure to check your spam folder as well before reaching out.
* **Compromised wallet:** You can sign to forgo your allocation on your dashboard so that the hacker cannot get it. Due to the scale and custom work required, we are unable to help you to reallocate this year unlike last year.
