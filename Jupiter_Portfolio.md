# Jupiter Portfolio
## 1. Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q)

### 1.1. A protocol is missing, where do I report ?

If a protocol is missing from Jupiter Portfolio, you can submit a request [here.](https://feedback.jup.ag/b/portfolio-feedback)  
  
Our team will review it and work on adding it as soon as possible!

### 1.2. My tokens are missing, how do I add them ?

There is few reasons why your tokens might be missing from your portfolio dashboard :

1. The token has very low liquidity onchain and therefore we are not able to show a relevant price for this token
2. The token is very new and we don't price it yet
3. A bug is causing the token not to show

If you think this token should be displayed, please fill a ticket [here](https://support.jup.ag/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=18486452428188) with all the necessary details (mint, wallet) and we will investigate.
